# Crowdfunding ETL Project


## Project Overview

The Crowdfunding ETL Project creates a database starting from a couple of excel files in different formats, which are extracted and transformed using Python and Pandas.\n
Later, a database is designed -creating the ERD diagram- and created using PostgreSQL.\n
Finally, some queries are made to create tables with data from various tables.
